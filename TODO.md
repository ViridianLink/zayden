# Zayden TODOs

- Split messages over 2000 characters in 2 parts in 🐜丨support-help. They can be 4000 max, so splitting right after 2000 should be fine
- Fix !WisdomOfTheDay command
- Update ℹ丨information (and add Kai)
- Delete support commands when they return nothing. (!support lmao should delete the message from the bot and my message a few seconds after being issues f.e.)
- Change !update to College Kings 2 instead of Act 4 (we should probably go with company standard stuff, idk)
